Weâ€™re writing a Point of Sale (POS) software application for a shave ice
company. This company has kiosks which have minimal electricity and
limited hardware resources, and it has sweet air-conditioned stores
with all the electricities.

Employees in the kiosks must write their orders on tickets and can only accept cash. 
    When an employee takes a ticket order, 
        they should enter the Order Number into the system. 
    When an employee takes a cash payment, 
        they should enter the amount of the sale and the amount of the payment and display the change.

Employees in the stores have a fancy computer to take orders on and can accept cash and credit cards. 
    When an employee takes a computer order, 
        the Order Number should be generated by the computer. 
    When an employee takes a credit card payment, 
        they should enter the creditcard number and the amount of the sale.

Assignment 1: Draw a class diagram for your solution using whatever
means necessary.
Assignment 2: Implement this POS system in Java using the Strategy

work as expected.
